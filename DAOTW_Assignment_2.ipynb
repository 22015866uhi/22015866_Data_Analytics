Each dataset incrementally introduces more weather-related variables, starting from basic data on the day of the week and number of collisions, and gradually including temperature, precipitation, and dew point. This progressive approach allows us to understand the impact of each additional weather variable on the accuracy of our predictions.\n"

        "The primary objective of this analysis was to develop regression models that could predict the number of traffic collisions on any given day in New York City, aiding the emergency services in optimizing their response strategies. Three different models were developed and compared:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model 1 (Linear Regression with 'day'):** Utilised only the day of the week as the predictor variable. The predictions from this model indicated a progressive increase in the number of collisions as the week progressed, with the highest number of collisions predicted for day 7 which is Friday. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for this model was approximately 112.16.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model 2 (Linear Regression with 'day' and 'temp'):** Included both the day of the week and temperature. This model provided a nuanced understanding, showing that specific combinations of days and temperatures led to higher predicted collisions. For instance, the model predicted the highest collisions on day 7 with a temperature of 89.1. The MAE for this model was slightly lower than Model 1 at 110.32.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model 3 (Linear Regression with 'day', 'temp', and 'dewp'):** This model indicated that certain combinations of day, temperature, and dew point were critical in predicting higher collision numbers. For example, the highest collisions were predicted on day 7 with a temperature of 89.1 and a dew point of 72.1. The MAE for this model was lower than the other two models at 63.97. It is the most accurate model among the three due to the inclusion of these additional features likely allows the model to capture more nuances and factors that influence the number of collisions, leading to more accurate predictions.\n",
