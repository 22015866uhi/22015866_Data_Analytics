The primary objective is to develop predictive models that can accurately estimate the number of traffic collisions on any given day based on various weather parameters. This study is particularly significant for the emergency services in New York City, as it aims to enable them to optimize their emergency response strategies based on predictive insights.\n",

        "The analysis is divided into two parts: The first part involves constructing a linear regression model, a fundamental yet powerful tool for understanding and predicting relationships between variables. The second part, which will be discussed in a subsequent report, focuses on developing a Deep Neural Network (DNN) regression model, leveraging the advanced capabilities of machine learning.\n",

        "Four distinct datasets have been curated and hosted on GitHub for this analysis. Each dataset incrementally introduces more weather-related variables, starting from basic data on the day of the week and number of collisions, and gradually including temperature, precipitation, and dew point. This progressive approach allows us to understand the impact of each additional weather variable on the accuracy of our predictions.\n",

        "\n",
        "The primary objective of this analysis was to develop regression models that could predict the number of traffic collisions on any given day in New York City, aiding the emergency services in optimizing their response strategies. Three different models were developed and compared:\n",
        "\n",
        "Model 1 (Linear Regression with 'day'): Utilized only the day of the week as the predictor variable. The predictions from this model indicated a progressive increase in the number of collisions as the week progressed, with the highest number of collisions predicted for day 7. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for this model was approximately 600.67.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model 2 (Linear Regression with 'day' and 'temp'): Included both the day of the week and temperature. This model provided a nuanced understanding, showing that specific combinations of days and temperatures led to higher predicted collisions. For instance, the model predicted the highest collisions on day 7 with a temperature of 89.1. The MAE for this model was slightly higher than Model 1 at approximately 600.68.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model 3 (Linear Regression with 'day', 'temp', and 'dewp'): Added dew point to the features, providing an even more detailed analysis. This model indicated that certain combinations of day, temperature, and dew point were critical in predicting higher collision numbers. For example, the highest collisions were predicted on day 7 with a temperature of 89.1 and a dew point of 72.1. The MAE for this model was slightly lower than the other two models at approximately 600.65.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Insights and Recommendations:\n",
        "Progression Throughout the Week: All models consistently predicted an increase in collisions towards the end of the week, suggesting a need for heightened preparedness by emergency services during these days.\n",
        "\n",
        "Impact of Weather Conditions: Models 2 and 3, which included weather conditions (temperature and dew point), offered more detailed insights, although the improvement in prediction accuracy was marginal compared to Model 1. This suggests that while weather conditions do impact collision numbers, their predictive power may not be significantly stronger than the day of the week alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model Selection for Emergency Services: Given the marginal difference in MAEs among the three models, Model 1 (using only the day of the week) could be preferred for its simplicity and ease of interpretation. However, if the emergency services value the additional insights from weather conditions, Model 3 offers the most comprehensive analysis with a slightly better MAE.\n",
        "\n",
        "Final Note:\n",
        "While the models provide valuable insights, the predictions should be used as one of several tools in decision-making. Other factors, such as special events, traffic pattern changes, and city-wide initiatives, should also be considered in the planning process by the emergency services. Additionally, the close MAE values across all models suggest that further refinement or incorporation of additional data sources could be explored to enhance predictive accuracy."
